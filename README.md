# design-process-wizard

## The Goal

This project is intended to demonstrate my design process from problem identification all the way to solution delivery. 

Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all "design process" that one can follow to achieve a goal. Or maybe that's not unfortunate? :thinking-face: Who knows? 

> But what about double-diamond, service design process, and any other existing frameworks? Surely, there's merit to them, right?

Of course there's merit to these types of processes! At a certain level, they'll all apply to this project in some fashion. That said, it's important to recognize that the best design processes are emergent, and will present themselves to you during the course of the project. Be ready to pivot.

> But where do I *start*?

That's where this wizard comes in! Just as you're beginning to plan out your project, this wizard can help build out the initial task list for an initiative. Once you're done, download the CSV and import it to JIRA to begin mapping tasks there.
